# Dual-Graph — Compounding Context for Claude Code & Codex CLI

A context engine that makes Claude Code and Codex CLI **30-45% cheaper** without sacrificing quality. It builds a semantic graph of your codebase and pre-loads the right files into every prompt — so Claude spends tokens reasoning, not exploring.

Works on **macOS, Linux, and Windows**. Supports any project size.

Supports **TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Swift, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, and PHP**.

## How It Works

```
You run: dgc /path/to/project
         ↓
1. Project scanned → semantic graph built (files, symbols, imports)
2. You ask a question
3. Graph identifies the relevant files → packs them into context
4. Claude gets your question + the right code already loaded
5. Fewer turns, fewer tokens, better answers
```

Token savings **compound** across a session. The graph remembers which files were read, edited, and queried — each turn gets cheaper.

## Results

Benchmarked across 80+ prompts (5 complexity levels) on a real-world full-stack app:

| Metric | Without Dual-Graph | With Dual-Graph |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Avg cost per prompt | $0.46 | **$0.27** |
| Avg turns | 16.8 | **10.3** |
| Avg response time | 186s | **134s** |
| Quality (regex scorer) | 82.7/100 | **87.1/100** |

Cost wins on **16 out of 20** prompts. Quality equal or better on all complexity levels.

## Install

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunal12203/Codex-CLI-Compact/main/install.sh | bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc / ~/.profile
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunal12203/Codex-CLI-Compact/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows (Scoop):**
```powershell
scoop bucket add dual-graph https://github.com/kunal12203/scoop-dual-graph
scoop install dual-graph
```

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+, Claude Code or Codex CLI. The installer detects missing tools and offers to install them via winget (Windows) or homebrew (macOS).

## Usage

### Claude Code (`dgc`)

```bash
dgc                              # scan current directory, launch Claude
dgc /path/to/project             # scan a specific project
dgc /path/to/project "fix the login bug"   # start with a prompt
```

### Codex CLI (`dg`)

```bash
dg                               # scan current directory, launch Codex
dg /path/to/project              # scan a specific project
dg /path/to/project "add tests"  # start with a prompt
```

### Windows

```powershell
dgc .                            # from inside the project directory
dgc "D:\projects\my-app"         # any drive, any path
dg "C:\work\backend"             # Codex CLI
```

## What It Does Under the Hood

1. **Scans your project** — extracts files, functions, classes, import relationships into a local graph. Supports TS/JS, Python, Go, Swift, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, and PHP.
2. **Pre-loads context** — when you ask a question, the graph ranks relevant files and packs them into the prompt before Claude sees it. No extra tool calls needed.
3. **Remembers across turns** — files you've read or edited are prioritized in future turns. Context compounds.
4. **MCP tools available** — Claude can still explore the codebase via graph-aware tools (`graph_read`, `graph_retrieve`, `graph_neighbors`, etc.) when it needs to go deeper.

All processing is local. No code leaves your machine.

## Data & Files

All data lives in `<project>/.dual-graph/` (gitignored automatically).

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `info_graph.json` | Semantic graph of the project: files, symbols, edges |
| `chat_action_graph.json` | Session memory: reads, edits, queries, decisions |
| `context-store.json` | Persistent store for decisions/tasks/facts across sessions |
| `mcp_server.log` | MCP server logs |

Global files in `~/.dual-graph/`:
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `dgc.ps1` / `dg.ps1` | Launcher scripts (auto-updated) |
| `venv/` | Python virtual environment for dependencies |
| `version.txt` | Current installed version |

---

## Configuration

All optional, via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DG_HARD_MAX_READ_CHARS` | `4000` | Max characters per file read |
| `DG_TURN_READ_BUDGET_CHARS` | `18000` | Total read budget per turn |
| `DG_FALLBACK_MAX_CALLS_PER_TURN` | `1` | Max fallback grep calls per turn |
| `DG_RETRIEVE_CACHE_TTL_SEC` | `900` | Retrieval cache TTL (15 min) |
| `DG_MCP_PORT` | auto (8080-8099) | Force a specific MCP server port |

---

## Context Store

Decisions, tasks, and facts from your sessions are persisted in `.dual-graph/context-store.json` and re-injected at the start of the next session. This gives Claude continuity across conversations.

You can also create a `CONTEXT.md` in your project root for free-form session notes.

---

## Token Tracking

A token-counter dashboard is registered automatically with Claude Code:

```
http://localhost:8899
```

Usage from inside a Claude session:
```
count_tokens({text: "<content>"})   # estimate tokens before reading
get_session_stats()                  # running session cost
```

---

## Self-Update

The launcher checks for updates on every run and auto-updates if a new version is available. No manual intervention needed.

Current version: **3.9.30**

---

## Privacy & Security

- **All project data stays local.** Graphs, session data, and code never leave your machine.
- The only outbound calls are:
  - **Version check** — fetches a version string (no project data).
  - **Heartbeat** — sends a random install ID and `platform` only. No hardware fingerprinting, no file names, no code.
  - **One-time feedback** — optional rating after first day of use.
- `.dual-graph/` is automatically added to `.gitignore`.

---

## Uninstall

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.dual-graph
sed -i.bak '/\.dual-graph/d' ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null
rm -rf .dual-graph .claude/settings.local.json
claude mcp remove token-counter --scope user 2>/dev/null
claude mcp remove dual-graph 2>/dev/null
rm -rf ~/.claude/token-counter
rm -f ~/.claude/token-counter-stop.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.dual-graph" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$p = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","User") -split ";" | Where-Object { $_ -notlike "*\.dual-graph*" }
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", ($p -join ";"), "User")
Remove-Item ".dual-graph" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item ".claude\settings.local.json" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
claude mcp remove token-counter --scope user 2>$null
claude mcp remove dual-graph 2>$null
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\token-counter" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\token-counter-stop.ps1" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

> The PATH/project commands remove the global install. Run the project-local commands inside each project you used dual-graph with.
